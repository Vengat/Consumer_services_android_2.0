# Consumer_services_android_2.0
Second version with fragments
Hyperlocal is the next frontier for e-commerce companies to bring massive scale and deliver goods instantly. 
While we see the rise of on-demand startups like Grofers, Peppertap and Jugnoo among others, e-commerce giants Flipkart, Amazon, Snapdeal and Paytm see hyperlocal as the next avenue to accelerate scale.

This is a small contribution for people who are interested to sustain and compete with the tech enabled competitiors. 

This is an android application that can talk to restful services. The server side code too is provided here.
